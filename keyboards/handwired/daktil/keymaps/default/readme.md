# Dactyl Default Configuration

## Changelog
* Aug 2019:
  * Add dynamic macros and CAPS LOCK to the first daktil keyboard build in ljudmila
  * cherry switch on e stopped working (and I thought they were invincible) so there is now a single silver switch in whole keyboard of red ones.

* Nov 2017:
  * Copied and adapted from the Ergodox EZ equivalent
  * Notable differences:
    - Don't try to have the columns that don't exist, naturally
    - Removed RGB keys, since there are no RGB LEDs in the Dactyl (as designed, at least)

## Keyboard

This branch applies to classic dactyl keyboard with red/white croatian keycaps.
